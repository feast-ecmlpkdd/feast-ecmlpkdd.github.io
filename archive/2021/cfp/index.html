<hr />
<p>The FEAST workshop aims to address the <strong>challenges of the contemporary job market and human resources management</strong> by means of <strong>data-driven solutions</strong> that better enable all relevant stakeholders to achieve their goals in a fair, effective, and sustainable manner, including the job seekers, employers, HR agencies, HR managers, policy makers and government agencies, training facilities, and more. The challenges for which data science can make a genuine difference are numerous: Workers need better job recommendations and career advice; Employers need better HR and recruitment strategies, with due consideration of ethical constraints; Policy makers need to understand how to regulate the job market to ensure efficiency, fairness, and inclusion; And much more.</p>

<p>We <strong>invite contributions advancing the state-of-the-art on these topics</strong>, to be presented at the <strong>FEAST workshop</strong> which is to be held online during and as part of the <strong>European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practices of Knowledge Discovery from Data (ECML-PKDD)</strong>, 13 – 17 September 2021.</p>

<h2 id="non-exhaustive-list-of-topics-of-interest">Non-exhaustive list of topics of interest</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Job market analytics</li>
  <li>Job recommender systems (models and systems, explainability/transparency, actionability, fairness/bias,…)</li>
  <li>AI for curriculum and career advice</li>
  <li>NLP for analyzing, writing, and editing CVs and job adverts</li>
  <li>Taxonomies and ontologies for HR data (creation and use cases)</li>
  <li>Knowledge graphs for HR data (creation and use cases)</li>
  <li>Visualisation techniques applied to HR data</li>
  <li>Representation learning for HR data</li>
  <li>Data-driven strategic workforce planning</li>
  <li>Data-driven methods for identifying skills gaps and emerging skills</li>
  <li>Data-driven methods for monitoring and enhancing job satisfaction</li>
  <li>Data-driven methods for the detection of occupational hazards and burn-out</li>
  <li>Ethical and legal issues in the use of AI for HR management (privacy, fairness, transparency,…)</li>
  <li>Inclusion of vulnerable groups in the job market</li>
  <li>Privacy-preserving methods in HR management</li>
</ul>

<p>Contributions are solicited on methods as well as systems, on theory as well as applications, from academia as well as industry and government agencies. While ethical issues may be a core focus of a contribution, <strong>we strongly encourage possible ethical benefits or concerns to be explicitly considered</strong> also in contributions where it is not the core focus.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-format">Workshop format</h2>
<p>FEAST is a full-day workshop, featuring:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A keynote talk from from either industry, government or academia.</li>
  <li>Spotlight presentations</li>
  <li>Contributed presentations</li>
  <li>A poster session</li>
  <li>A panel discussion between the keynote speakers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submission-information">Submission information</h2>
<p>All papers will be peer-reviewed, single-blinded. We solicit submissions of different types:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recent results published elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Previously unpublished novel research results.</li>
  <li>Previously unpublished position papers.</li>
  <li>Previously unpublished concise surveys.</li>
</ol>

<p>Authors should indicate in the submission form the type of their submission. <strong>For submission of type 1, the previously published paper may be submitted.</strong> The main criteria for acceptance of these submissions are fit to the workshop scope and impact. <strong>For submissions of types 2, 3, and 4, extended abstracts of up to 6 pages are solicited</strong> (excluding references and supplemental material), and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style. The main criteria for acceptance of these submissions are fit to the workshop scope, possible impact, and novelty. As the main purpose of the workshop is to stimulate discussions and interaction, maturity of the work will not be a criterion for acceptance, as long as the maturity is sufficient to stimulate a constructive discussion. All submissions must be in pdf format, written in English. <strong>Uploading submitted manuscripts to arXiv or to other preprint repositories is allowed</strong> (and even encouraged), and <strong>simultaneous submission to another conference or journal is permitted</strong> (subject to the constraints imposed by these venues).</p>

<p>By default, accepted contributions will be offered a <strong>short (~2min) pre-recorded spotlight presentation</strong> and a place in the <strong>poster session</strong>. Particularly thought-provoking contributions may be offered a <strong>longer presentation</strong> slot alongside a place in the poster session.</p>

<p>Accepted contributions will be <strong>posted on the workshop website (unless the authors opt out)</strong>, but will not be published in a formal proceeding. Given enough interest by the workshop participants, we plan to <strong>organize a special issue of a leading journal</strong>. In that case, we will issue a public call for papers, and invite high quality contributions accepted at our workshop to submit extended versions.</p>

<p>For accepted contributions, at least one author must register for the conference and attend the workshop to present the work.</p>
