            Katrien Verbert is Associate Professor at the Augment research group of KU Leuven. She obtained a doctoral degree in Computer Science in 2008 at KU Leuven, Belgium. She was a postdoctoral researcher of the Research Foundation – Flanders (FWO) at KU Leuven. She was an Assistant Professor at TU Eindhoven, the Netherlands (2013 –2014) and  Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium (2014 – 2015). Her research interests include visualisation techniques, recommender systems, explainable AI, and visual analytics. She has been involved in several European and Flemish projects on these topics, including the EU ROLE, STELLAR, STELA, ABLE, LALA, PERSFO, Smart Tags and BigDataGrapes projects. She is also involved in the organisation of several conferences and workshops (general co-chair IUI 2021, program chair LAK 2020, general chair EC-TEL 2017, program chair EC-TEL 2016, workshop chair EDM 2015, program chair LAK 2013 and program co-chair of the EdRecSys, VISLA and XLA workshop series, DC chair IUI 2017, DC chair LAK 2019).

On one hand, job seekers might specify their requirements (e.g., type of contract, max mobility distance). The interaction matrix can then be used to measure the difference between what they want and what they get, in a given environment. A first question is whether an RS system will increase this difference, and how to mitigate these potentially negative impacts. A second question is to measure the prejudices of a given RS platform: can we state that some job seeker profiles are less well served than others ? (and why). A third question is related to the possible impacts of the RS on the global job market in terms of congestion. What about using a population-based learning criterion ? Recommending job ads to job seekers raises some issues beyond the standard performance indicators of recommender systems (RS).";
