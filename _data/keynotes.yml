    talktitle: "Explaining job recommendations: a human-centred perspective"
    talk: The dynamics of the labor market and the tasks with which jobs are being composed are continuously evolving. Providing effective recommendations in this context has also been found to be particularly challenging. In this talk, I will present our work on dashboards that visualise predictions and job recommendations, and that provide actionable insights for job seekers. I will present lessons learned from user-centred design processes involving job seekers and job mediators, as well as future research challenges.
