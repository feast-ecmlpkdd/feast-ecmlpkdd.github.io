# Workshop outline
---
The workshop will be a combination of high-quality plenary events (keynote talks, a panel discussion between the keynote speakers, and possibly a select number of contributed presentations), combined with a poster session for the bulk of the contributed presentations. For the poster session, we plan to use the gather.town tool (unless the conference organization prefers us to use a different tool), which in our experience successfully allows interaction to occur despite a virtual setup.
