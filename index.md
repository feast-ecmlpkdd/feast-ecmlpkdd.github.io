# Overview

The job market of the 21st century poses a set of unique challenges. Automation through artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies will result in unprecedented shocks in the job market, with entire job categories disappearing while new types of jobs requiring new skills and competencies will emerge. While such shifts in the job market have happened before, the impact of the ongoing revolution may be larger and will unfold much faster than it did in the previous industrial revolutions. To mitigate the impact of this disruption, large parts of the workforce will need upskilling and retraining in a matter of years, and continuously thereafter.


The challenges of this new job market can be addressed by creating data-driven solutions to better enable the different actors to achieve their goals. The actors are the job seekers, the employers, HR agencies, policy makers, training facilities, government agencies, etc. Workers need better job recommendations and career advice. Employers need better HR and recruitment strategies, with due consideration of ethical constraints. Policy makers need to understand how to regulate the job market to ensure efficiency, fairness, and inclusion.
